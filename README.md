# SlenderMan

A slenderman game like Slender: The Eight Pages.

I started creating this on 17th October 2017, and my goal as to complete it in 2 weeks (In time for Halloween)

Made using C++/ OpenGL.

### Building:
<coming soon>

# The challenge

I started off using the simple SFML game framework, and created it from there.

This means the line total shown below is 857 lesser than the true value (Line of code of the framework I made.)

### Day 1 & 2

Day one was spent setting up basic OpenGL stuff, such as support for actually drawing in OpenGL, 3D, an FPS camera, and a simple render system

### Day 3

Today I did not get much done due to some kind of flu.

However, what I did do was get model loading in the game. This uses a parser my friend wrote a while back while following the ThinMatrix OpenGL tutorial.

Before this, I tried using TinyOBJ and Assimp, but neither of those worked.

### Day 4

Today was started off by getting terrain to be generated and render, and finished off with some
lighting effects
